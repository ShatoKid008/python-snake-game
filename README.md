# python-snake-game
Followed Engineer Man's YouTube tutorial to make a snake game in python using random &amp; curses modules
Tutorial can be found on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbasThWVb-c&list=WL&index=7&t=2s
Downloaded windows-curses in order for program to work
Amended code in tutorial so (x,y) positions of food are int, not float, which wasn't shown in the tutorial
Program isn't working, currently trying to figure out why - Error message is 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fileno' which is linked to IDE, but not sure how. If you know, let me know
